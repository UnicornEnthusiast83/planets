Unicorns are so magical. Who doesn't love unicorns?
People who don't love unicorns are dead inside. Or they just don't have an imagination which is sad AF. Unicorns are goddamn majestic. 
JK. Maybe these people just don't want to be 'basic bitches'. Which is it's own flavor of sadness, but whatevs. Life is complex.
